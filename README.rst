Public deployments
==================

A test deployment (following the ``dev`` branch) is deployed on https://cortical-voluba.apps-dev.hbp.eu. |uptime-dev|  The corresponding front-end is https://voluba-dev.apps-dev.hbp.eu/.

The public deployments are managed by OpenShift clusters, the relevant configuration is described in `<openshift-deployment/>`_.


Documentation
=============

A `draft API documentation <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEcL3rchH6OL-qWFaUQdXy9QU39r7Oh81ayneaurm6k/edit?usp=sharing>`_ is available.


Development
===========

The backend uses `highres-cortex`_ and `ANTs`_, both of which must be available the ``PATH``. You can use `<docker-highres-cortex/script.sh>`_ to build a Docker image containing highres-cortex (a pre-built image is available on Docker Hub: `ylep/highres-cortex <https://hub.docker.com/r/ylep/highres-cortex>`_). You can use `<docker-highres-cortex-ants/Dockerfile>`_ to add the relevant ANTs tools (a pre-built image is available on Docker Hub: `ylep/highres-cortex-ants <https://hub.docker.com/r/ylep/highres-cortex-ants>`_).

The compute-intensive alignment runs on a task queue that uses `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`_. It needs to be configured with a broker (Redis was tested successfully), see `First steps with Celery`_. The queue runner needs to be started separately::

Useful commands for development:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/cortical-voluba.git

  # Install in a virtual environment
  cd cortical-voluba
  python3 -m venv venv/
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install -e .[dev]

  export FLASK_APP=hbp_spatial_backend
  flask run  # run a local development server
  celery --app=cortical_voluba worker --loglevel=info  # run the task queue

  # Tests
  pytest  # run tests
  pytest --cov=hbp_spatial_backend --cov-report=html  # detailed test coverage report
  tox  # run tests under all supported Python versions

  # Please install pre-commit if you intend to contribute
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install  # install the pre-commit hook
